     <center><div class='border3'><p>Setting your personal body goals can be hard when looking into the mirror. Your probably thinking "How am I going 
     to change my body and I have never even done one push up or ran one mile, let alone one sprint." First step is to visualize it.
     You do not have to go to the gym and work out, as a matter of fact you can go to the gym and just sit. You see greatness rubs off
     on the fortunate and miss fortunate. Visualization is key.</p></div></center>

     <center><div class='border3'><p>It's suprising but there are alot of people who need help developing the perfect workout plan and mental healthness plan.
       Some people really need help being the best person they can be. There is a science behind making sure you are ok with the newlife style 
       you want. i am making this entry because there are people who just enjoy working out alone or just dont have alot of fitness friends, want to
       get better endurance, want to lift more, etc. Remember to know your body and know what you want to do with your body. Most trainers will just 
       jump into the workout and not think about that everybody is not like them. In hindsight you want to know what your blood type, your fitness
       level and your enjoyment! Always have fun but and make the best out of each workout. Above is a good progression sheet that will help you keep
       your goals intact. please download it.

<center><div class='border3'><p> This article will be covering macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are big food properties like 
         proteins and fats that everybody needs to help us keep a metabolism stable. Try to visit your doctor or talk to your buddies 
         about the foods you guys consume. There are different proteins and good fats you can eat when it comes to your diet and what you
         are looking to change about your way of eating throughout your day. Alot of starchy foods like potatoes can help you gain weight and keep
         it packed on. When you want to keep your body in to tip top shape you want to make sure there are proper micronutrients coorelated into 
         your diet. There should be a good balance of acid and vitamins that are essential to your health. Grains, nuts, other minerals and side 
         dressings like honey. Watch out for diabeties and people with high blood pressure. Making sure you have the right amount of water incorporated 
         into your diet helps bring out some of the toxins and keep your liver out of the grave. Plus the last bit I want you to go away with is learning
         how to control your emotions i personally am a stress eater so I eat nuts and other small snacks. Something to keep me going and stimulated
         you have to know when your body has had enough.
